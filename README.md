# COVID-Help-Phone-Number
Just a small piece of code I wrote while quarantined
NC CDC Help Line 1-866-462-3821 Question and Answer 
```
print ('Do you want to take the Carona Test in North Carolina :Type in "Yes or No"')
good='Yes'
aid='phone'
good = input()
if (good == 'Yes' or good == 'yes'):
    print ('The address is 1801 Glendale Dr SW, Wilson, NC 27893. ' +
    'If you need the Helpline, type "phone" and if not type in "No".')
    aid = input()
    if (aid=='phone' or aid == 'Phone'):
            print("NC CDC Help Line 1-866-462-3821. Don't forget to wash your hands.")
    else:
        print('You have elected to do nothing silly human scum, good luck.')

```
